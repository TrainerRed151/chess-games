1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. f3 e6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. a3 Ba5 6. Be3 Ne7 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Ne2 Nd7
9. O-O e5 10. Qe1 c5 11. b4 cxb4 12. axb4 Bxb4 13. Qg3 Qb6 14. exd5 Bxc3 { I
thought I was cleverly removing the knight as a defender of the d4 square. I
calculated out that if my opponent moved to Na5 with tempo on my queen, I could
go to Qf6 to defend the pawn. Then after Bg5, I thought I was okay because I
could play Qd6. But I forgot that the pawn was no longer on e5 to shield my
queen. } 15. Nxc3 exd4 16. Na4 Qf6 17. Bg5 Qe5 { In retrospect, trading the
queens when I was about to be down a piece was a bad idea. In the moment, I was
just thinking about how the move protected the knight on e7 without blundering
the queen. } 18. Qxe5 Nxe5 19. Bxe7 Re8 20. Bc5 Nxd3 { I thought knight for
bishop, plus setting up the pawn-bishop-pawn skewer for my rook after 20. cxd3
Rd8 21. Bxd4 Rxd5 looked good. } 21. cxd3 Rd8 22. d6 { I saw the pawn move back
when I traded the knight for the bishop. Thought I had b6, but didn't realize
until now that the rook would hang after Nxb6. } 22... Bf5 23. Rfd1 b6 { Now b6
works } 24. Bxd4 Rxd6 25. Nxb6 Rb8 { I saw the skewer after Be5, but figured a
bishop and a knight for a rook and a pawn (Rxa7 at the end of the trades) would
have to do. } 26. Be5 Rbxb6 27. Bxd6 Rxd6 28. Rxa7 h6 29. d4 Be6 30. g4 g5 31.
Kg2 Bd5 32. Kg3 Rf6 33. Rf1 Rf4 34. Rd7 Rxd4 35. Rc1 Rd3 36. Rf1 Kg7 37. h4 Kf6
{ Apparently the engine liked 37... gxh4+. I was surprised to see that because I
thought keeping the king from getting to the f4 square was important. } 38.
hxg5+ hxg5 39. Kh2 { Not sure why my opponent gave me a free pawn and out of the
pin. This is the first moment since I lost my knight that I thought I might be
able to pull off a draw. } 39... Rxf3 40. Rxf3+ Bxf3 41. Kg3 Be2 { I first
played Bc6 here, but luckily saw the obvious fork just as I was about to release
the bishop. } 42. Rd2 Bc4 43. Kf3 Be6 44. Re2 { I spent almost 15 min after Re2
trying to deside if this was a drawn position or if either side had winning
chances. And also, how do I pull off the draw without losing. After deciding
that I didn't have winning chances, I offered my opponent a draw. He turned it
down and said the reason was because he had 45 min left on his clock and I only
had 15 min left. I could tell he was upset that he blew his big lead in the
middle game, and probably still wanted the win. } 44... Bd5+ 45. Ke3 Be6 46. Rg2
Ke5 47. Rg1 Bc8 48. Rg3 Be6 49. Rg1 Bc8 { Just trying to get the draw by
repetition. } 50. Rf1 Be6 { I thought my drawing chances were better not trading
the pawns. } 51. Kf3 Bd5+ 52. Kg3 Be6 53. Re1+ Kf6 54. Rf1+ Kg6 55. Rc1 Kf6 56.
Rc6 Ke5 57. Kf3 { I felt really bad for my opponent after this move, blundering
the fork. Especially since he had turned down the draw offer. } 57... Bd5+ 58.
Kg3 Bxc6 59. Kh3 Kf4 60. Kh2 Kxg4 61. Kg1 Kh3 62. Kf2 f5 63. Kg1 g4 64. Kf2 Kh2
